## Test project using Serenity-BDD and Cucumber
Set up the serenity.conf file before running.

For example:
Fill in the website base URL: `webdriver.base.url = "https://www.mywebsite.org"`  
Choose to run webdriver in headless mode or not: `headless.mode = false`

The project includes webdriver binaries to run the tests.

## Test execution
Execute `gradle clean test` to run the test.  
Currently there might be some problems running this with JDK 11.  
Gradle version 4 or 5 with JDK 8 should work.
