## Test project using Serenity-BDD and Cucumber

### Project Config
Set up the `serenity.conf` file before running.
This file is located in: `/src/test/resources/`

For example:
Fill in the website base URL: `webdriver.base.url = "https://www.mywebsite.org"`  
Choose to run webdriver in headless mode or not: `headless.mode = false`

The project includes webdriver binaries to run the tests.

### Test execution
From the root fodler of the project it is possible to use gradlew on the commandline.  
on Unix/Linux `./gradlew test`  
on windows: `gradlew test`  

Or use IDE specific solutions to run gradle tasks:
Execute `gradle clean test` to run the tests.  
    
__Currently there are some problems running this with JDK 11.__  
Gradle version 4 with JDK 8 should work.
